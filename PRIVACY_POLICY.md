# Privacy Policy for Review Format Kit (RFK)

**Effective Date:** February 20, 2026

Review Format Kit (RFK) ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our browser extension.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**Review Format Kit does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

*   **User Data:** We do not collect your name, email address, physical address, or any other identifying information.
*   **Browsing History:** We do not track your browsing history. The extension only activates on `github.com` pull request pages to provide its core functionality.
*   **Convention Data:** Any custom convention groups or settings you create are stored locally on your device using the `chrome.storage.local` API. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly opt-in to "Team Sync".

## 2. Team Sync Feature

The "Team Sync" feature allows you to sync convention groups from a remote JSON URL.
*   **Network Requests:** When this feature is active, the extension will make periodic network requests to the URL provided by you or your team lead.
*   **No Data Transmission:** These requests are for **fetching** data only. The extension does not send any of your local settings or personal data to these remote URLs.

## 3. Data Storage

All settings and configurations are stored locally in your browser's internal storage. We do not have access to this data.

## 4. Third-Party Services

RFK interacts with GitHub to inject its user interface components. We do not share any data with GitHub or any other third parties.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our GitHub repository.

## 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us via our GitHub repository issues.
